# Years-To-Days

Basic website to convert your birth date to total days you've been alive.
I created this website in order to keep up my web design skills and learn
a little bit more about React.

## About

Originally I was going to write this program without the use of the [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
Javascript object. However, soon into the project I learned of the existence of
the Date object and decided to shift focus to using it as its existence
simplified the project greatly. If you want to see the original way I was
planning on making this project the code is in the **develop** branch. This
code is not finished and doesn't work properly however it is about 80%
of the way there.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo onto your machine.
2. From the command line **cd** into the cloned repo.
3. Run the following command in order to run webpack:
```
npm create
```
4. After webpack has completed run the following command in order to launch the
web server:
```
npm start
```
5. A browser window should open automatically directing you to localhost:8080
with the program running.
    * If this does not occur simply open up any modern browser (that means no IE)
    and navigate to localhost:8080
